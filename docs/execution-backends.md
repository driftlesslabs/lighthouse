# Running with or without Sharrow

Lighthouse supports two configurations, following the overlay pattern in
[ActivitySim's MTC example](https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim-prototype-mtc/tree/extended/configs_sh).
The base configuration uses original zone IDs; the Sharrow overlay enables compilation and recoding
together. Do not toggle only one of these settings.

- `model/configs`: `sharrow: false`, `recode_pipeline_columns: false`.
- `model/configs_sh` over the base configs: `sharrow: require`, `recode_pipeline_columns: true`.

The non-Sharrow skim dictionary maps original zone IDs through the OMX mapping. With recoding
enabled, it instead uses zero-based positions; those are only correct if the land-use order matches
OMX storage. Lighthouse's inputs have different orders. Sharrow explicitly realigns the skim dataset
to land-use zone IDs before switching to recoded indices, so recoding is both required and safe on
that path. Input files do not need to be reordered or rewritten.

## Commands

From the Lighthouse repository root, with the locked environment installed:

```sh
# Multiprocessing settings come from configs_mp; base evaluation uses NumPy/pandas.
uv run --locked activitysim run -c model/configs_mp -c model/configs \
  -d model/data -o model/output_numpy --ext extensions

# Put the Sharrow overlay ahead of the other configuration directories.
uv run --locked activitysim run -c model/configs_sh -c model/configs_mp -c model/configs \
  -d model/data -o model/output_sharrow --ext extensions
```

For a single-process run, omit `-c model/configs_mp`. Use separate, fresh output directories for
each run; do not resume an old checkpoint with a different backend or recoding configuration.
Outputs from both modes decode origins, destinations, and assigned locations back to source zone
IDs.

`--ext extensions` is required for Lighthouse's constraints, telework components, and safe skim
loading. The locked Sharrow 2.15 loader uses threaded Dask reads during realignment. Lighthouse's
`skim_loading` extension limits Dask to one worker because concurrent PyTables/HDF5 reads can crash.
This does not limit ActivitySim's worker processes or change compiled utility expressions.

Destination **sampling** uses the reference evaluator in both modes: small differences in compiled
cumulative probabilities can move a random draw across a sample boundary and change downstream
locations. Logsum and final-choice evaluation still compile. This is an explicit subcomponent
setting, not an automatic compiler fallback. The existing scheduling exclusions remain in place.

The school-bus and tour/trip mode specifications disable fast-math because their inputs can contain
NaN school distances or infinite walking limits. Strict IEEE semantics preserve the NumPy comparison
behavior. The model also now supplies the child-count column referenced by telecommute frequency and
removes leading whitespace rejected by the CDAP expression compiler. Behavioral coefficients are
unchanged.

The documented `python uv-local` runner can replace `uv run --locked` for sibling-source
development. Recent development versions support an additional trip-mode chunk budget in
`model/configs_explicit_chunk`; add that directory before the other configs when using a compatible
version. The locked ActivitySim 1.5.1 release rejects that trip-mode setting, so it is not in the
base configuration or CI runs. The other existing component chunk settings remain in place.

## Backend stability checks

```sh
uv run --locked pytest tests -q
uv run --locked python scripts/model_ci.py --sharrow off --output model/output_ci_off
uv run --locked python scripts/model_ci.py --sharrow require --output model/output_ci_sh \
  --compare-to model/output_ci_off
```

Both runs use the same frozen 2,000-household fixture, seed 0, and two workers. The comparator
aligns decoded households, people, tours, and trips by ID and requires identical choices, schedules,
locations, capability flags, and all other non-logsum attributes. Only logsum columns permit
floating-point roundoff (`rtol=1e-5`, `atol=1e-5`); the report records the maximum absolute
difference for each. Missing entities, mismatched columns, changed decisions, and larger logsum
discrepancies fail CI. Internal `_original_` columns created solely by recoding are excluded.

PR/main CI runs this pair. Scheduled/manual jobs also compare the larger fixture and the
single-process fixture. The ordinary historical distribution baselines remain advisory; they are not
substituted for the blocking backend comparison. Old distributions from the incorrectly recoded
non-Sharrow configuration are not a valid geographic reference for the corrected runs.

The CI runner gives each run a fresh compiled-expression cache and a separate shared-memory skim
name. It also verifies matching input/configuration/extension hashes, seed, package versions,
household fixture size, and process mode before accepting a comparison.

`tests/test_skim_backends.py` additionally loads an intentionally shuffled, asymmetric OMX fixture
through each actual backend and verifies origin/destination and time-period values against known
answers. This catches mapping mistakes even when a stochastic model run happens to select the same
modes. Model startup also exercises required compilation rather than allowing silent fallback.

## Validation of this configuration

Local validation with locked ActivitySim 1.5.1 and Sharrow 2.15.0 passed all 56 contract tests.
Cold-cache, two-worker backend comparisons passed for both the 2,000-household and 10,000-household
fixtures (seed 0). All non-logsum outputs matched exactly; the largest absolute logsum differences
were approximately 2.44e-6 and 2.63e-6, respectively. The larger pair produced 27,049 tours and
69,400 trips in each backend. The scheduled single-process pair is configured in CI but was not
included in these local full-fixture comparisons.
